     ii/. The architecture used is Model View Viewmodel (MVVM), due to fact that it is more advanced and the
          best architecture for developers instead of using of MVP and MVC which is obsoleted and was realized to have some weakness

     iii/. The Following are some third party libraries I used

     1.) // lifecycle
     // ViewModel and LiveData
     implementation 'androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-extensions:2.2.0'
     annotationProcessor "androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-compiler:2.5.1"

    2.) // For Kotlin we recommended to use kapt instead of annotationProcessor
    // glide for image
    implementation "com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.12.0"
    kapt "com.github.bumptech.glide:compiler:4.12.0"

    3.) // retrofit
    implementation "com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.6.2"
    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.6.2'

    4.) ///for dimens and screen responsiveness for many devices to render the graphical user interface friendly and responsive according to screen size
    implementation 'com.intuit.ssp:ssp-android:1.0.6'
    implementation 'com.intuit.sdp:sdp-android:1.0.6'
